Description: A breakpoint-based method to detect ontogenetic shifts in 
  univariate time-activity budget series of central-place foraging insects. 
  The method finds a single breakpoint according to the likelihood function. 
  The method was developed with honey bees in order to detect the Age at 
  Onset of Foraging (AOF), but can be used for the detection of other 
  ontogenetic shifts in other central-place foraging insects.
